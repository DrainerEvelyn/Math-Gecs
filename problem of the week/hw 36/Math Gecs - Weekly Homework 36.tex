\begin{solution*}
Notice $n^{2} + 2n + 12 = (n+1)^{2} + 11$. For this expression to be equal to a multiple of 121, $(n+1)^{2} + 11$ would have to equal a number in the form $121x$. Now we have the equation $(n+1)^{2} + 11 = 121x$. Subtracting $11$ from both sides and then factoring out $11$ on the right hand side results in $(n+1)^{2} = 11(11x - 1)$. Now we can say $(n+1) = 11$ and $(n+1) = 11x - 1$. Solving the first equation results in $n=10$. Plugging in $n=10$ in the second equation and solving for $x$, $x = 12/11$. Since $12/11$ *$121$ is clearly not a multiple of 121, $n^{2} + 2n + 12$ can never be a multiple of $121$.
\end{solution*}

\begin{solution*}
In order for $121$ to divide $n^{2} + 2n + 12$, $11$ must also divide $n^{2} + 2n + 12$.
\\ \\
Plugging in all numbers modulo $11$:
\\ \\
$0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,$ or $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, (-5), (-4), (-3), (-2), (-1)$ to make computations easier,
\\ \\
reveals that only $10$ satisfy the condition ${n^{2} + 2n + 12} \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$.
\\ \\
Plugging $10$ into ${n^{2} + 2n + 12}$ shows that it is not divisible by $121$.
\\ \\
Thus, there are no integers $n$ such that $n^{2} + 2n + 12$ is divisible by $121$.
